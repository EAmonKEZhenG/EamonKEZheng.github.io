  <h1>WooDowel ‚Äî Electrode Isolation for Electromagnetic Shielding in Triboelectric Plywood Sensors</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      WooDowel is an interdisciplinary research project exploring how natural wood can become an interactive sensing medium.
      The work investigates <b>electrode isolation and electromagnetic shielding</b> in triboelectric plywood sensors ‚Äî 
      a method enabling stable, noise-resistant signal acquisition even when the electrodes overlap inside multi-layered wood panels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project was presented at <b>CHI 2024</b> (Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems),
      the world‚Äôs leading venue for human‚Äìcomputer interaction research.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
    <p>
      The WooDowel system builds upon triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) principles ‚Äî 
      converting mechanical vibrations into electrical signals via the triboelectric effect. 
      Our key contribution was redesigning the plywood structure to balance signal sensitivity, 
      EM shielding, and structural durability.
    </p>
    <img src="pic/woodowel_structure.png" alt="Cross-section showing electrode isolation layers">
    <p>
      Each sensor layer consists of copper electrodes overlapping across a PTFE triboelectric film, 
      sandwiched between grounded EM-shielding layers. 
      These layers are interconnected through <strong>3D-printed conductive dowels</strong> that 
      act as modular switches ‚Äî woodworkers can ‚Äúturn off‚Äù damaged regions by replacing a conductive dowel 
      with a wooden one. This preserves most of the sensor‚Äôs area and prevents short circuits.
    </p>
    <!-- ADD IMAGE -->
    <img src="pic/dowel_design.png" alt="Cross-section showing electrode isolation layers">
    <p>
      To improve usability, we integrated a <strong>short-circuit detector</strong> ‚Äî a small buzzer module that 
      alerts users when a nail or screw causes a short. 
      This makes WooDowel more practical for real woodworking environments.

    <p>
      We also investigated how material types (hardwood, softwood, MDF) and panel thickness affect 
      signal strength. Results showed hardwood plywood yielded the highest output voltage and 
      stable sensing performance across common household activities such as writing, sawing, 
      and drilling ‚Äî even with nearby electronic interference.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data & Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The vibration signals were analyzed using <b>Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)</b> to extract dominant features.
      Classification models such as Random Forests and SVMs achieved up to <b>93.2% recognition accuracy</b> for distinguishing interaction types.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      As a computer science student, hardware prototyping and wood-based sensing were far from my comfort zone.
      Thanks to the patience and guidance of my mentors and lab members, I gradually learned how to merge software algorithms with physical material design.
      Each debugging session ‚Äî from writing Python classification scripts to Using machine tools to produce wood panel materials ‚Äî deepened my understanding of what it means to
      bridge computation and the real world.

    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>
      Special thanks to my supervisors and collaborators ‚Äî 
      <b>Dr. Teyen Wu, Dr. Xingdong Yang, Dr. Yuning Su, and Dr. Yonghao Shi (names are listed in alphabetical order, without implying any priority)</b> ‚Äî
      for their incredible support and mentorship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their guidance not only helped me understand complex physical concepts, but also showed me
      how collaborative research brings ideas to life across disciplines.
