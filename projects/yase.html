    <h1>YASE: Yet Another Storage Engine</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            YASE is a high-performance, ACID-compliant storage engine built from scratch in C++.
            Developed as a course project for CMPT 454 (Database Systems II), it handles intricate data management
            tasks,
            including buffer pooling, concurrent indexing, transaction logging, and recovery.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The engine is composed of several tightly integrated modules, each addressing a critical aspect of database
            internals:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Buffer Manager:</strong> Implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy with
                pin/unpin logic to efficiently manage data pages in memory, optimizing for cache coherence.</li>
            <li><strong>Index Manager:</strong> A concurrency-safe <strong>SkipList</strong> implementation that
                supports high-throughput insertions and lookups, utilizing atomic operations and fine-grained locking
                for thread safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Manager:</strong> Ensures ACID properties through a 2PL (Two-Phase Locking) Lock
                Manager and a Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Log Manager for crash recovery and atomicity.</li>
            <li><strong>Disk Storage:</strong> Custom page layout and slotted record management to optimize disk I/O
                operations.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Performance & Results</h2>
        <p>
            In the final group performance race, our team achieved <strong>2nd Place</strong> among all competing
            groups.
            Our engine demonstrated superior throughput in multi-threaded benchmarks, handling high-contention workloads
            with minimal latch contention.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also implemented a comprehensive benchmarking framework (similar to TPC-C components) to validate the
            performance of our SkipList and Buffer Manager under various load conditions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Building YASE was a deep dive into the "black box" of database systems. I was personally responsible for
            implementing the Skiplist index,
            Log Manager, Lock Manager, and the benchmarking framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the biggest challenges was debugging concurrency issues in the SkipList — memory leaks and race
            conditions were frequent guests.
            Using tools like Valgrind and rigorous unit testing (Google Test) helped us stabilize the system.
            Collaborating with my teammates, Gurman and Dylan.
