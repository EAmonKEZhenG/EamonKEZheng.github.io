My journey started with a box of LEGO robots. The first time I “programmed” one to move, I felt a spark — and that spark has been my compass ever since.

Today, I’m a Master’s student in Big Data at Simon Fraser University, still chasing that same excitement of building and solving. Along the way, I’ve worked as a Research Assistant at SFU, exploring human–computer interaction and smart sensing, and as a data engineer at Movmint, where I learned what it takes to optimize real-world systems at scale.

But outside data and code, another dream quietly simmers — I want to become a good cook.  
Before coming to Canada in 2019, I had never stepped into a kitchen. My mother cooked every meal for me, so cooking was something I deeply appreciated but never understood. Like many international students, I started cooking just to survive. But dish by dish, I found myself loving the process — the rhythm, the small creativity in every plate, and that wonderful (you know, sometime people lie) compliment from friends: “Wow, this is really good!” That moment of sharing feels strangely similar to programming — both start from raw ingredients and end with something that makes people happy.

And yes, when I’m not experimenting with flavors, I’m probably playing video games. They’ve been my way to reset, to find calm. No matter how chaotic the day gets, that virtual world feels like a lighthouse, reminding me why I love technology in the first place.

I believe technology is not just about machines, but about people. I enjoy building connections as much as I enjoy building systems. That’s why I co-founded *Big O One*, a student-led initiative that brings industry professionals and graduates back to campus to share their journeys — helping peers bridge the gap between university and the working world.

I don’t see myself as one of those geniuses who create OpenAI or Tesla. But I love exploring new ideas, learning new things, and trying (sometimes failing) to make cool stuff work. As we say in Chinese, **学无止境 (xué wú zhǐ jìng)** — “learning has no limit.”  
That, and maybe one day opening a small restaurant, are the two things that keep me moving.`,
